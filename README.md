# 🛰️ ProjectShores – Protecting Canadian Shorelines with Satellite Data  

## 🌍 Overview  
Canada has the largest coastline in the world, and its shorelines are increasingly threatened by climate change. Rising ocean temperatures, melting Arctic ice, and new trade routes pose risks to both ecosystems and communities.  

Our project focuses on **three key factors**:  
1. **Melting ice** → new Arctic shipping routes are opening.  
2. **Shipping routes** → increased vessel traffic near Canadian coastlines.  
3. **Leatherback turtle migration** → endangered species at risk from habitat changes and vessel collisions.  

By combining satellite Earth Observation data with data feeds, a prototype was built that visualizes and predicts risk zones where **climate change, human activity, and biodiversity overlap**.

## 🛠 Data Sources  
- **RADARSAT / Sentinel-1** → Sea ice extent and melt patterns.  
- **Satellite AIS (Automatic Identification System)** → Ship positions and routes.  
- **Tagging datasets (DFO/WWF)** → Leatherback turtle migration corridors.  
- **Open geospatial layers** → Canadian coastlines and erosion maps.

## 🤖 Approach  
1. **Data Integration**  
   - Mapped ice extent, turtle migration corridors, and shipping routes on a single geospatial layer.  
   - Highlighted overlap “red zones” where risks to coastlines and wildlife are highest.  

2. **Prediction with AI**  
   - Concept model: forecasts where ice will retreat, how migration routes shift, and where shipping routes are likely to overlap.  
   - Provides **early warnings** for coastal managers and shipping authorities.  

3. **Protection Outcomes**  
   - Identify safer shipping corridors away from sensitive habitats.  
   - Inform conservation policy for marine ecosystems.  
   - Support shoreline protection by reducing human-caused pressure.
